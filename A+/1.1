Getting true black is difficult with LCD
Different type of  light source - florescen,t or LED. Its hard to difficult to repair and replace




TN LCD= bad angle, we need to look at display directly
Good for gaming

VA lcd - slow response time








We see anthena on top of display laptop, its 802 wireless wire bluetooth device







CCFL - old laptop uses it. It needs more power than LED light.






These are strips of LED 


We need inverter because CCFL black lights need AC power,but our laptop is using DC power. Inverter convert DC power from laptop and convert it to AC



We can use PEN to write on screen because of the digitizer.
Digitzer converts that analog input onto the display into digital signals tht the computer can use
