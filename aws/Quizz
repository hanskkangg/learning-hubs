EC2 Instance Savings Plans Correct!  EC2 Instance Savings Plans reduce your EC2 instance costs when you make an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and Region for a 1-year or 3-year term. 


 
Which AWS service is the best choice for publishing messages to subscribers?
The correct response option is Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

You want to use an Amazon EC2 instance for a batch processing workload. What would be the best Amazon EC2 instance type to use?
- The correct response option is Compute optimized.
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. This instance family would not be the best choice for the application in this scenario. Compute optimized instances are more well suited for batch processing workloads than general purpose instances.
	· Memory optimized instances are more ideal for workloads that process large datasets in memory, such as high-performance databases.
	· Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage. The question does not specify the size of data that will be processed. Batch processing involves processing data in groups. A compute optimized instance is ideal for this type of workload, which would benefit from a high-performance processor.


What are the contract length options for Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances? (Select TWO.)
The two correct response options are:
	· 1 year
	· 3 years
Reserved Instances require a commitment of either 1 year or 3 years. The 3-year option offers a larger discount.


 
You have a workload that will run for a total of 6 months and can withstand interruptions. What would be the most cost-efficient Amazon EC2 purchasing option?
The correct response option is Spot Instance.
 
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· Reserved Instances require a contract length of either 1 year or 3 years. The workload in this scenario will only be running for 6 months.
	· Dedicated Instances run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. They have a higher cost than the other response options, which run on shared hardware.
	· On-Demand Instances fulfill the requirements of running for only 6 months. However, a Spot Instance would be the best choice because it does not require a minimum contract length, is able to withstand interruptions, and costs less than an On-Demand Instance.


Which process is an example of Elastic Load Balancing?
The correct response option is Ensuring that no single Amazon EC2 instance has to carry the full workload on its own.

You want to deploy and manage containerized applications. Which service should you use?

The correct response option is Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).
 
Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service. Kubernetes is open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

Which statement best describes an AWS account’s default network access control list?
 
The correct response option is It is stateless and allows all inbound and outbound traffic. 
Network access control lists (ACLs) perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound.


 
Which statement best describes DNS resolution?
The correct response option is Translating a domain name to an IP address.

 
For example, if you want to visit AnyCompany’s website, you enter the domain name into your PC and this request is sent to a DNS server. Next, the DNS server asks the web server for the IP address that corresponds to AnyCompany’s website. The web server responds by providing the IP address for AnyCompany’s website, 192.0.2.0.
 
 
 
 
 
Your company has an application that uses Amazon EC2 instances to run the customer-facing website and Amazon RDS database instances to store customers’ personal information. How should the developer configure the VPC according to best practices?
The correct response option is Place the Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet and the Amazon RDS databases instances in a private subnet.

 
Which component can be used to establish a private dedicated connection between your company’s data center and AWS?
The correct response option is AWS Direct Connect.
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· A private subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources that should be accessed only through your private network. Although it is private, it is not used for establishing a connection between a data center and AWS.
	· DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a directory used for matching domain names to IP addresses.


 
Which statement best describes security groups?
 
The correct response option is Security groups are stateful and deny all inbound traffic by default.
 
Security groups are stateful. This means that they use previous traffic patterns and flows when evaluating new requests for an instance.
 
By default, security groups deny all inbound traffic, but you can add custom rules to fit your operational and security needs.

 
Which component is used to connect a VPC to the internet?
 
The correct response option is Internet gateway.

 The other response options are incorrect because:
	· A public subnet is a section of a VPC that contains public-facing resources.
	· An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content for faster delivery to customers.
	· A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.

 
Which service is used to manage the DNS records for domain names?
 
The correct response option is Amazon Route 53.
 
Amazon Route 53 is a DNS web service. It gives developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users to internet applications that host in AWS.
 
Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names. You can transfer DNS records for existing domain names managed by other domain registrars. You can also register new domain names directly in Route 53.
 
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define.
	· AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and VPC.  
	· Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery service. It uses a network of edge locations to cache content and deliver content to customers all over the world.

 
Which of the following are characteristics of the Amazon EBS service? (Select TWO.)
 
 The correct responses are as follows:
	· Best for data that requires retention
	· Separate drives from the host computer of an EC2 instance
 


 
 
You want to store data that is infrequently accessed but must be immediately available when needed. Which Amazon S3 storage class should you use?
 
The correct response option is S3 Standard-IA.
 
The S3 Standard-IA storage class is ideal for data that is infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed. Both S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones. S3 Standard-IA provides the same level of availability as S3 Standard but at a lower storage price.
 
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· In the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, Amazon S3 monitors objects’ access patterns. If you haven’t accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, S3 Standard-IA. If you access an object in the infrequent access tier, S3 automatically moves it to the frequent access tier, S3 Standard.
	· S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive are low-cost storage classes that are ideal for data archiving. They would not be the best choice for this scenario, which requires high availability. You can retrieve objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class within a few minutes to a few hours. By comparison, you can retrieve objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class within 12 hours.


 
What are the scenarios in which you should use Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)? (Select TWO.)
The two correct response options are:
	· Using SQL to organize data
	· Storing data in an Amazon Aurora database

	· Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Objects stored in the Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class can be retrieved within a few minutes to a few hours. By comparison, objects that are stored in the Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class can be retrieved within 12 hours.
 
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· Amazon S3 Standard is a storage class that is ideal for frequently accessed data, not archival data.
	· Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns of objects and automatically moves them between the Amazon S3 Standard and Amazon S3 Standard-IA storage classes. It is not designed for archival data.
	· Amazon S3 Standard-IA is ideal for data that is infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed.


 
Which statement or statements are TRUE about Amazon EBS volumes and Amazon EFS file systems?
The correct response option is: EBS volumes store data within a single Availability Zone. Amazon EFS file systems store data across multiple Availability Zones.
 
An EBS volume must be located in the same Availability Zone as the Amazon EC2 instance to which it is attached.
 
Data in an Amazon EFS file system can be accessed concurrently from all the Availability Zones in the Region where the file system is located.

You want to store data in an object storage service. Which AWS service is best for this type of storage?
The correct response option is Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
 
The other response options are incorrect because:
	· Amazon Managed Blockchain is a service that you can use to create and manage blockchain networks with open-source frameworks. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that lets multiple parties run transactions and share data without a central authority.
