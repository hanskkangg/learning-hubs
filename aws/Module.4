VPC let you provision a logically isolated section of the aws cloud where you can launch aws resources in a virtual network that you define. These resources can be public facing or private with no internet access
 
VPC allow you to define your privateIP range for your aws resources and you place things like ec2 instances and ELBs inside your VPC. You place them into different SUBNETS. Subnets are chunkcs of IP addresses in your VPC that allow you to group resources together.



Internet gateway is like a front door to your coffee shop without it no one can reach your coffee shop.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
Imagine the millions of customers who use AWS services. Also, imagine the millions of resources that these customers have created, such as Amazon EC2 instances. Without boundaries around all of these resources, network traffic would be able to flow between them unrestricted. 
A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)(opens in a new tab).
Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets. A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.



 
Internet gateway
To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an internet gateway to the VPC.
An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. You can think of an internet gateway as being similar to a doorway that customers use to enter the coffee shop. Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.

 
Virtual private gateway
To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. 
Here’s an example of how a virtual private gateway works. You can think of the internet as the road between your home and the coffee shop. Suppose that you are traveling on this road with a bodyguard to protect you. You are still using the same road as other customers, but with an extra layer of protection. 
The bodyguard is like a virtual private network (VPN) connection that encrypts (or protects) your internet traffic from all the other requests around it. 
The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC. Even though your connection to the coffee shop has extra protection, traffic jams are possible because you’re using the same road as other customers. 



 
 
AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect(opens in a new tab) is a service that lets you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.  
Suppose that there is an apartment building with a hallway directly linking the building to the coffee shop. Only the residents of the apartment building can travel through this hallway. 
This private hallway provides the same type of dedicated connection as AWS Direct Connect. Residents are able to get into the coffee shop without needing to use the public road shared with other customers. 

Network ACL – this checks to see if the packet has permissions to either leave or enter the subnet based on who it was sent from and how its trying to communicate. Its like a passport control officer.
However, it doesn’t evalute if a packet can reach a specific EC2 instances.


Security group is stateful – meaning it has some memory when it comes to who to allow in or out, and network ACL is stateless – it doesn’t remember nothing. It checks every packet every sinle packet.s

 
Subnets
A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private. 


Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website.
Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers’ personal information and order histories. 
In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. For example, you might have an application that involves Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.
